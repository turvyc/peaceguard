## Description

PeaceGuard is an iPhone application designed to complement the Vancouver Police
Department’s Community Policing Program. Community patrol volunteers will be able to track
the distance and time of each of their patrols, along with the route they travelled. As well, should
they encounter a community disturbance on their patrol (or even when they are not patrolling),
volunteers will be able to make an incident report, which uploads a report of the incident to a
server, where it is viewable by police.

PeaceGuard also uses gamification techniques to encourage and reinforce the desired behavior of
a volunteer – namely, patrolling often and well. Volunteers will be able to track their personal
patrol statistics, earn badges and achieve milestones.

PeaceGuard. You’re not just walking. You’re patrolling.
